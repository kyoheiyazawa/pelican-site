<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is my infrequently updated blog site as well as a site for me to try out web ideas.</p>
<p>I'm currently using my site design to experiment with web minimalism. I often feel fatigued browsing the web. Many pages load slowly and have very loud designs, and something related to the content you read seems to show up in the ads you see the next day. My site doesn't include any tracking code and uses the browser default serif font to minimize network calls. I also tried to keep the site CSS minimal, just making a few tweaks to how the browser displays HTML by default. I took a lot of design inspiration from <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html">Low-tech Magazine's solar powered website</a>, which was designed with the purpose of minimizing energy usage. I love how using default fonts and simple styling not only makes their site more functional, but also gives it a unique look.</p>
<p>The site is created using Pelican static site generator, and hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>
