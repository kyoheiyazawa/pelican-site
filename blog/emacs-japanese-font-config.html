<h1>Emacs Japanese Font Config</h1>

<p>I'm currently trying out using emacs as my main editor. I especially like that I can open up the eww web browser in a window, and research things on the web without leaving emacs. It is a big problem when I am coding, switch over to my browser to research a problem I have, and 30 minutes later find myself on Wikipedia reading about some random nematode found in Atlantic fish. eww is surprisingly functional for a text based web browser, but it is ugly and clunky enough to keep me focused on my work.</p>
<p>I discovered that Japanese text renders horribly in emacs/eww. This is on Fedora Linux. When I opened a Japanese site in eww, it was a terrible mix of serif and sans-serif fonts, some of which were anti-aliased and some that were not.</p>
<p>I struggled to find a simple solution to this when searching on the English language web. However, I immediately found a great solution on the Japanese web, on <a href="http://asukiaaa.blogspot.com/2017/11/ubuntuemacs.html">this blog post</a>.</p>
<p>All I needed was this one-liner in my emacs config:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">(set-fontset-font t &#39;japanese-jisx0208 &quot;Noto Sans CJK JP&quot;)</span>
</pre></div>


<p><br>
Set the font name as desired. The addition of this line to my emacs config seems to be working great for my needs. I now have consistent font display on Japanese sites in eww. </p>
