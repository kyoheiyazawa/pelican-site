<h1>American Idiot: A Retrospective</h1>
<p class="article-date">March 23 2019</p>
<div id="article-contents-container">
<p><em>American Idiot</em> is one of the most popular albums by Green Day. Released in 2004, it delivered chart-smashing success for Green Day against the backdrop of the 2004 U.S. presidential election and its overarching theme — the Iraq War. Though the album is full of strong singles such as "Holiday" and "Wake Me Up When September Ends," the entire album is tied together by a rock opera concept in the same vein as the Who's <em>Tommy</em>. <em>American Idiot</em> tells the story of Jesus of Suburbia, a troubled, unremarkable teen from a generic American suburb.  </p>
<p><em>American Idiot</em> was the hottest shit when it came out while I was in middle school. Everyone went nuts about it and the songs were all over the radio. The black Parental Advisory label on the CD cover prevented some kids from obtaining the CD but strengthened its anti-authoritarian message. We resented Tipper Gore's legacy while wishing her husband were the president instead of the Doonesbury asterisk who sat in the White House. The album is packed full of catchy songs, and I can still play all of the songs from the album on guitar — an easy accomplishment since the entire album is power chords over meat and potatoes sort of progressions. While a lot of good music was produced in this era, <em>American Idiot</em> more than any other album of this time confronted head-on the alienation I and my peers felt at suburban monoculture and American chauvinism close to home, and the criminal acts of an isolated America abroad. I grew up in the environs of Boulder, a blue enclave within red Colorado. I imagine people who grew up elsewhere experienced this era quite differently. Thinking back on it now, I think that the Bush II era is when the fraying apart of American society really began in earnest. <em>American Idiot</em> is for me (and I suspect many others of my generation) the definitive soundtrack to this important time period in our lives and American history.  </p>
<p>Here are my top 3 tracks from <em>American Idiot</em>, ranked.  </p>
<h3>3. Give Me Novacaine</h3>

<p>The intro has a sweeter melody compared to the rest of the songs on the album and a slide guitar sound lends it a slightly loopy feel. The song's theme of sedation works well with the contrast in sound between this part and the aggressive electric guitar-backed verses, which are classic Green Day. Stabbing the V chord at the end of the chorus to build tension is stereotypical Green Day as well.</p>
<h3>2. Boulevard of Broken Dreams</h3>

<p>The incredibly iconic intro of "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is probably my second favorite usage of guitar tremolo (my favorite is in the epic outro of the song "Black Sabbath" on the album <em>Black Sabbath</em> by the band Black Sabbath). Note that Green Day repeat their trick of ending the chorus by hammering on the V chord in this song — why mess with a winning formula?  </p>
<h3>1. Jesus of Suburbia</h3>

<p>"Jesus of Suburbia" seems be the song where Green Day tried their hardest to realize their rock opera concept for <em>American Idiot</em>. The song transitions seamlessly between five movements, each with a completely different sound and character. It is nine minutes long and not boring for a single second. Near the end of the last "Tales of Another Broken Home" movement there is a lovely "movement within a movement" that is one of my favorite parts of the song but always throws me off when I play this song on guitar. </p>
