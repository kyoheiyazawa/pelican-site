Title: Stephen King: Maximum Overdrive

I have never actually read a Stephen King novel, though I have watched and enjoyed many movies based off of his stories such as _Carrie_, _It_, and _Gerald's Game_. However, I recently finished his memoir _On Writing_, which I highly recommend to anyone interested in writing as a craft. In the book, King briefly recounts his life and career and lets you peek under the hood of his hit factory. King is full of unpretentious and solid writing advice that is sure to benefit anyone who takes writing seriously.  

But aside from the writing advice, this disarmingly honest passage from the book piqued my interest:  
> Besides, if you really did write a stinker—it happens; as the author of _Maximum Overdrive_ I'm qualified to say so...  
  
Perhaps this is some of that King magic in action—this passage had me dying to learn more about his worst work. In _Maximum Overdrive_, Stephen King is more _auteur_ than author. _Maximum Overdrive_ is a movie based on the Stephen King short story "Trucks," and it is also the first and only movie directed by King. Stephen King makes a cameo appearance in the film as a man who becomes enraged when a rogue ATM display tells him that he is "an asshole," and he even appears in the movie's trailer, which you can watch below:

My favorite part of the trailer is when Stephen King points at the camera with crazed-looking eyes and says, "I'm going to scare the hell out of you!" This is a refreshing change from modern trailers that show too much and ruin the plot and the best jokes of a movie, so more directors should do this. According to Wikipedia and multiple YouTube commenters, King was in a cocaine-addled state for much of this movie's production, so that could explain his strange appearance in the trailer.  
  
As you can tell from the trailer, _Maximum Overdrive_ has a fabulous soundtrack that is a mix of 80's synth sounds and the music of AC/DC, which was a brilliant directorial choice. AC/DC's obnoxious anthems are the ideal match for the atmosphere of this strange movie.  
  
The setup of the movie is that humanity comes under attack when some sort of supernatural comet casts its dark influence upon Earth, causing all machines to become sentient and murderous. Our main characters seek refuge in a rural truck stop as 18-wheelers circle around them. Stepping outside means certain death accompanied by a weird alarm sound that plays whenever a truck kills someone.  
  
I can understand Stephen King referring to this movie as a "stinker," because it is undeniably bad. I did end up watching the whole movie, but I do have to agree with the assertion that "the trailer was scarier than the movie lol" by YouTube commenter BigKnGa. The acting is mediocre to bad all around, and the story is fairly boring at times due to a lack of action. The worst of these lulls is when the humans are forced to spend hours refueling an endless caravan of 18-wheelers queued up at the truck stop while "Hells Bells" by AC/DC plays in the background.  
  
A more fundamental problem with this movie is that trucks are simply not that scary on screen. Trucks are mundane looking, rather plain objects. Mechanical villains being unscary is a problem in other films as well, such as the 2004 _I, Robot_ starring Will Smith. We humans still react most viscerally to our animal fear of a threatening pair of eyes, and sharp, glistening teeth and claws. Though the trailer shows Stephen King standing in front of a truck with a horrifying devil face on the front (please, give whoever designed this prop an award!), I was disappointed to learn that the face is not the result of a supernatural transformation, but is simply a plastic display ornament placed on the truck by its owner before the start of the truck rebellion. After watching the trailer, I was expecting a dark Thomas the Tank Engine sort of thing where all of the trucks sprout horrible faces. Perhaps this was not possible due to budget or the production possibilities of the time. With advancements in CGI technology, I have great hopes for a remake of this film directed by a now sober Stephen King, starring trucks transformed by dark cosmic magic into horrifying giant beasts with jaws dripping with malice and motor oil that devour any human in their path.
